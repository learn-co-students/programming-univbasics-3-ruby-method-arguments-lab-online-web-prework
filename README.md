 # Ruby Method Arguments Lab

## Learning Goals

- Define a method that takes in and uses an argument
- Define a method that takes in and uses two arguments
- Define a method with an optional argument

## Introduction

Now that we've seen a few ways of defining methods to add key functionality to
our programs, let's try writing our own methods. You can use the
tests to help guide you by running `learn` or `learn test` in your terminal,
however, this look familiar to you now.

You'll be coding your methods in `lib/introduction.rb`.

## Define a Method That Takes in and Uses an Argument

Define a method, `#introduction` that takes in the argument `name` and outputs
the phrase: `"Hi, my name is #{name}."`

## Define a Method That Takes in and Uses Two Arguments

Define a method, `#introduction_with_language` that takes in two arguments,
`name` and `language` and outputs the phrase: "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am
learning to program in #{language}."

## Define a Method With an Optional Argument

Copy the previous method and name it `#introduction_with_language_optional`. It
that takes in two arguments,`name` and `language`, but language is optional. The
default value for `language` will be "Ruby".

## Conclusion

We've talked about defining methods and passing in both required and optional
arguments. This will be the foundation of creating a lot of functionality in
Ruby.
